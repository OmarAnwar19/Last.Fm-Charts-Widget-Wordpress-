== Description ==

While creating a custom WordPress theme and website, for a music-based website, I started looking for a widget which would allow me to insert the current hot music charrts, as well as other related charts. My search came up empty, and I decided to create my own widget plugin to solve this need. This plugin, comes with a fully functional widget, which allows users to insert the current Top Tracks, Top Artists, or Top Tags charts, using the Last.Fm API. Created in a modern, fully object oriented fashion, using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS, this plugin also uses modern tools such as Composer, and Webpack to insure a smooth experience.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `lastfm-charts.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add your Last.Fm API Key in the settings menu
4. Add the widget into your website, programatically, or through the customizer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin / widget without a Last.Fm API Key? =

No, the plugin, nor the widget, will work without an API Key.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
First full version of the plugin.
